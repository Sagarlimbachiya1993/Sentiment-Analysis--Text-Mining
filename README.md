# Sentiment-Analysis--Text-Mining
This is a comprehensive analysis focusing on data exploration, dimensional modeling considerations, and programming techniques applied to a dataset containing customer reviews for clothing items.
The project aims to extract valuable insights from the provided dataset through meticulous data processing, dimensional modeling, and sentiment analysis techniques.

Dataset Overview:

The dataset encompasses an array of attributes including Clothing ID, Age, Title, Review Text, Rating, Recommended IND, Positive Feedback Count, Division Name, Department Name, and Class Name, forming the foundation for detailed analysis and exploration.

Dimensional Modeling Insights:

The project emphasizes the significance of dimensional modeling to enhance data organization and analysis. Considerations for Time, Product, Customer, and Review dimensions have been highlighted, providing a structured framework to delve deeper into temporal trends, product characteristics, customer segmentation, and sentiment-based review analysis.

Data Processing and Analysis Techniques:

The project initiates with JSON file parsing into a Pandas Data Frame, followed by labeling reviews into positive and negative sentiments based on the 'Rating' attribute. Extensive text preprocessing and sentiment analysis techniques were employed, including lowercasing, special character removal, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for refined textual analysis.

Machine learning methodologies were applied for sentiment prediction, resulting in a classification model achieving an impressive 90% accuracy. The model underwent thorough evaluation, presenting precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for both positive and negative sentiment categories.

Conclusion:

The project culminates by underlining the vital role of programming techniques in data exploration, labeling, preprocessing, and sentiment analysis. It highlights the potential amplification of insights through the integration of dimensional modeling concepts into the data analytics process, enriching business decision-making capabilities.
